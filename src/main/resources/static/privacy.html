<h1>OrcasXI Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: January 2026</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The OrcasXI App ("the App") is a mobile application developed specifically for the members of the Orcas Cricket Team. 
This App acts as a WebView interface for the team services hosted at: https://parthikrish6.github.io/orcas-services-web/.
</p>

<h2>1. Scope and Transparency</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This Privacy Policy outlines how we manage data within the App. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our players and ensuring that team statistics are handled in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) as set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Information Collection and Login</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To maintain a secure and private environment for our cricket team:</li>
    <li>Manual Provisioning: There is no "Sign Up" or open registration feature. Login credentials (usernames and passwords) are created by the team administrator and provided to players manually.</li>
    <li>Minimal Data Collection: We do not collect or request sensitive personal information such as your phone number, home address, or private email address through the app interface.</li>
    <li>Anonymity: Since accounts are provided manually, users are identified within the system by their team-assigned credentials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Use of Team Data</h2>
<p>
The App is designed to display performance data, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Match results and schedules.</li>
    <li>Player statistics (batting averages, bowling figures, strike rates).</li>
    <li>Team announcements.</li>
    <li>Anonymity: Since accounts are provided manually, users are identified within the system by their team-assigned credentials.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This data is used solely for the internal management and recreational purposes of the Orcas Cricket Team. We do not sell, trade, or share this performance data with any third-party marketing or data analytics companies.
</p>
<h2>4. Permissions and Hardware Access</h2>
<p>
OrcasXI is designed to be as non-intrusive as possible. The App requires no device permissions to function.
</p>
<ul>
<li>We do NOT access your Camera, Microphone, or Contacts.</li>
<li>We do NOT access your device's Photo Gallery or Storage.</li>
<li>We do NOT track your GPS or precise location.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services and Hosting</h2>
<p>
The App content is hosted on GitHub Pages.
</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub Logs: As with most web hosting services, GitHub may collect basic diagnostic "Log Data" (such as IP addresses, browser types, and access timestamps) to ensure the security and availability of the service.</li>
<li>External Links: For further details on how GitHub manages this technical data, please refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Data Security and Integrity</h2>
<p>
We take reasonable steps to protect the team's data from unauthorized access.
<p>

<ul>
<li>Security: Access is restricted to authorized members with valid credentials. We urge players not to share their login details with anyone outside the team.</li>
<li>Correction of Data: Players have the right to request the correction of any inaccurate statistics or personal details held within the App. Please contact the team administrator for any updates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
OrcasXI does not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13 without parental consent. If we become aware that an individual under 13 has been provided an account without appropriate oversight, we will take steps to manage that account according to legal requirements.
<p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our team operations or legal obligations. Players will be notified of significant changes, and the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy will be adjusted accordingly.
<p>

<h2>9. Contact Information</h2>
<p>
If you have any questions about this policy or wish to access or correct your data, please contact:
